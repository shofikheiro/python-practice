# Python Practice
**This is the documentation of my journey of playing with Python**

Started on 21 September 2024. I will documented every python code I make. They are mostly from my Coursera Courses.

Update (23 September 2024): <br>
I finished the Crash Course on Python on Cousera as part of my Bangkit 2024 Self-Study Course.
Access Certificate [here](https://coursera.org/share/750d427060d17f5368990ce0eecc09da). <br>
Most of my notes here are from there, plus extra notes from my instructor and other sources. Might gonna update them as I go back to look at my notes, maybe litte tweaks here and there, maybe be not. But I will add more updates as I learn more things on python.
