# List Comprehension Examples
You can create a list from an iterable using a for loop, which is a useful way to iterate over an iterable:
```python
new_list = []
for thing in list_of_things:
    new_list.append(do_something(thing))
```
Another way to do this is by using a list comprehension. List comprehension allows you to create a new list from an iterable (id: perulangan) in a single line. <br> 
```new_list = [do_something(thing) for thing in list_of_things]```<br>
List comprehensions can be used with tuples in Python, too. Here is an example of a list of tuples. In this example each tuple will contain the numbers 1, 2, and 3. This code will create 5 sets of (1,2,3).
```python
# Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
numbers = [(1, 2, 3) for _ in range(5)]
```
## ``For`` loop vs. list comprehension
The two code blocks below compare performing the same process using a list comprehension and a ```for``` loop. The line ``[x*2 for x in range(1,11)]`` is a simple list comprehension. This single line of code iterates over a range from 1 to 10, multiplies each element in the range by 2, and ultimately creates a new list from all multiples of 2 from 2 to 20. <br>
The second block of code below is a ``for`` loop designed to carry out the same function as the list comprehension. The ``for`` loop, however, requires three lines of code. 
```python
### Simple List Comprehension
print("List comprehension result:")

# The following list comprehension compacts several lines 
# of code into one line:
print([x*2 for x in range(1,11)])
```
```python
### Long form for loop
print("Long form code result:")

# The list comprehension above accomplishes the same result as
# the long form version of the code shown below:
my_list = []
for x in range(1,11):
    my_list.append(x*2)
print(my_list)
```
## List comprehensions with conditional statement
You can also use conditionals with list comprehension to build an even more complex and powerful statements. You can do this by appending an if statement to the end of the list comprehension. For example, ``[x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0]`` generates a new list containing all the integers divisible by 10 from 1 to 100. The `if` statement evaluates each value in range from 1 to 100 to check id it's evenly divisivle by 10. If it is, the number is added to the new list.
```python
print("List comprehension result:")
print([x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0])

# The list comprehension above accomplishes the same result as
# the long form version of the code:
print("Long form code result:")
my_list = []
for x in range(1,101):
    if x % 10 == 0:
        my_list.append(x)
print(my_list)

# Select Run to observe the two results.
```
List comprehension can be powerful, but they can also be complex, resulting in code that's hard to read. Be careful when using them, because they might make it more difficult for someone else looking at your code to easily understand what your code is doing. It is best practice to add descriptive comments about any list comprehensios used in your code. This helps to communicate the purpose of list comprehensions to other coders. Comments will also help you remember the goal of the code when performing future code additions and maintenance.
# Study Guide: List Operations and Methods
## Knowledge
### Common sequence operations
* **len(sequence)** - Returns the length of the sequence.
* **for element in sequence** - Iterates over each element in the sequence.
* **if element in sequence** - Checks whether the element is part of the sequence.
* **sequence[x]** - Accesses the element at index [x] of the sequence, starting at zero
* **sequence[x:y]** - Accesses a slice starting at index [x], ending at index [y-1]. If [x] is omitted, the index will start at 0 by default. If [y] is omitted, the len(sequence) will set the ending index position by default.
* **for index, element in enumerate(sequence)** - Iterates over both the indices and the elements in the sequence at the same time. <br>

Because integers are not iterable, they need to be converted to a range as such:
```python
for x in range(len(someList)):
    print(x)
# this will print out a numerical value up to the length of the original string
```
### List-specific operations and methods
* ``list[index]`` = x - Replaces the element at index [n] with x.
* `list.append(x)` - Appends x to the end of the list.
* `list.insert(index, x)` - Inserts x at index position [index].
* `list.pop(index)` - Returns the element at [index] and removes it from the list. If [index] position is not in the list, the last element in the list is returned and removed.
* `list.remove(x)` - Removes the first occurrence of x in the list.
* `list.sort()` - Sorts the items in the list.
* `list.reverse()` - Reverses the order of items of the list.
* `list.clear()` - Deletes all items in the list.
* `list.copy()` - Creates a copy of the list.
* `list.extend(other_list)` - Appends all the elements of other_list at the end of list
* ``map(function, iterable)`` - Applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list) and returns a map object with the results
* ``zip(*iterables)`` - Takes in iterables as arguments and returns an iterator that generates tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument iterables.
### Tuple use cases
Remember, there are a number of cases where using a tuple might be more suitable than other data types:
* Protecting data: Because tuples are immutable, they can be used in situations where you want to ensure the data you have cannot be changed. This can be particularly helpful when dealing with sensitive or important information that should remain constant throughout the execution of a program.
* Hashable keys: Because they're immutable, tuples can be used as keys on dictionaries, which can be useful for complex keys.
* Efficiency: Tuples are generally more memory-efficient than lists, making them advantageous when dealing with large datasets.

#### The ``tuple()`` operator
The ``tuple()`` operator is used to convert an iterable (like a list, string, or set) into a tuple. Let's see an example:
```python
# Convert a list to a tuple
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)

print(my_tuple)  # Outputs: (1, 2, 3, 4)

# Remember that although parentheses are often used to define a tuple, 
# they're not always necessary. The following syntax is also valid:

my_tuple = 1, 2, 3, 4
print(my_tuple)  # Outputs: (1, 2, 3, 4)
```
This can sometimes lead to confusion, particularly when tuples are used in function calls or with operators that also use parentheses.
##### Tuples with mutable objects
Although tuples themselves are immutable, they can contain mutable objects, such as lists. This means that although the tuple cannot be modified (for example, you can't add or remove elements), the mutable elements within the tuple can be changed.
```python
# A tuple with a list as an element
my_tuple = (1, 2, ['a', 'b', 'c'])

# You can't change the tuple itself
# my_tuple[0] = 3  # This would raise a TypeError

# But you can modify the mutable elements within the tuple
my_tuple[2][0] = 'x'  
print(my_tuple)  # Outputs: (1, 2, ['x', 'b', 'c'])
```
### Returning multiple values from functions
One of the most useful aspects of tuples in Python is their ability to return multiple values from a function. This allows a function to produce more than one result, providing flexibility and improving code readability.

Example: 
```python
def calculate_numbers(a, b):
    return a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b

result = calculate_numbers(10, 2)
print(result)  # Outputs: (12, 8, 20, 5.0)
```
In the above function, the four arithmetic calculations are returned as a tuple, which can be assigned to a single variable (result), or "unpacked" into multiple variables:
```python
def calculate_numbers(a, b):
    return a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b

add_result, sub_result, mul_result, div_result = calculate_numbers(10, 2)
print(add_result)  # Outputs: 12
print(sub_result)  # Outputs: 8
```
### List comprehensions
A list comprehension is an efficient method for creating a new list from a sequence or a range in a single line of code. It is a best practice to add descriptive comments about any list comprehensions used in your code, as their purpose can be difficult to interpret by other coders.
* **[expression for variable in sequence]** - Creates a new list based on the given sequence. Each element in the new list is the result of the given expression.
    * Example: ``my_list = [ x*2 for x in range(1,11) ]``
* **[expression for variable in sequence if condition]** - Creates a new list based on a specified sequence. Each element is the result of the given expression; elements are added only if the specified condition is true. 
    * Example: **my_list = [ x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0 ]**

Note that tuples do not have comprehensions but a similar functionality can be achieved with: <br>
``tuple(i for i in (1, 2, 3))``
### When to use ``for`` loops or list comprehensions
In Python, list comprehensions are generally used for creating new lists from existing ones in a concise and readable manner, especially when the task involves simple transformations or filtering of elements. <br>
``for`` loops are more versatile and are preferred when the operation is more complex, requires multiple lines of code, involves statements other than expression (like ``print``, ``pass``, ``continue``, ``break``), or when you need to iterate over a list without creating a new one.

## Coding Skills
### Skill Group 1
* Use a ``for`` loop to modify elements of a list.
* Use the ``list.append()`` method.
* Use the ``string.endswith()`` and ``string.replace()`` methods to modify the elements within a list.
```python
# This block of code changes the year on a list of dates.
# The "years" list is given with existing elements. 
years = ["January 2023", "May 2025", "April 2023", "August 2024", "September 2025", "December 2023"]

# The variable "updated_years" is initialized as a list data type 
# using empty square brackets []. This list will hold the new list
# with the updated years. 
updated_years = []
# The for loop checks each "year" element in the list "years".
for year in years:
    # The if-statement checks if the "year" element ends with the 
    # substring "2023". 
    if year.endswith("2023"):
        # If True, then a temporary variable "new" will hold the 
        # modified "year" element where the "2023" substring is 
        # replaced with the substring "2024".
        new = year.replace("2023","2024")
        # Then, the list "updated_years" is appended with the changed
        # element held in the temporary variable "new".
        updated_years.append(new)
    # If False, the original "year" element will be appended to the 
    # the "updated_years" list unchanged.
    else:
        updated_years.append(year)

print(updated_years) 
# Should print ["January 2024", "May 2025", "April 2024", "August 2024", "September 2025", "December 2024"]
```
### Skill Group 2
* Use a list comprehension to return values
```python
# This list comprehension creates a list of squared numbers (n*n). It
# accepts two integer variables through the function’s parameters.
def squares(start, end):
    # The list comprehension calculates the square of a variable integer 
    # "n", where "n" ranges from the "start" to "end" variables inclusively.
    # To be inclusive in a range(), add +1 to the end of range variable.
    return [n*n for n in range(start,end+1)] 

print(squares(2, 3))  # Should print [4, 9]
print(squares(1, 5))  # Should print [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares(0, 10)) # Should print [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```
### Skill Group 3
* Use a list comprehension to modify elements of a list.
* Use the ``string.replace()`` method within a list comprehension.
* Use the ``string[index]`` method within a list comprehension.
```python
# This block of code also changes the year on a list of dates using a
# different approach than demonstrated in Skill Group 1. By using a 
# list comprehension, you can see how it is possible to refactor the
# code to a shorter, more efficient code block. 

# The "years" list is given with existing elements.
years = ["January 2023", "May 2025", "April 2023", "August 2024", "September 2025", "December 2023"]

# The list comprehension below creates a new list "updated_years" to
# hold the command to replace the "2023" substring of the "year"
# element with the substring "2024". This action will be executed if
# the last 4 indices of the "year" string is equal to the substring
# "2023". If false (else), the "year" element will be included in the
# new list "updated_years" unchanged.
updated_years = [year.replace("2023","2024") if year[-4:] == "2023" else year for year in years]

print(updated_years) 
# Should print ["January 2024", "May 2025", "April 2024", "August 2024", "September 2025", "December 2024"]
```
### Skill Group 4
* Use the ``string.split()`` method to separate a string into a list of individual words.
* Iterate over the new list using a for loop.
* Modify each element in the list by slicing the element’s string at a given [1:] index position and appending the substring to the end of the element.
* Convert a list back into a string.
```python
# This function splits a given string into a list of elements. Then, it
# modifies each element by moving the first character to the end of the 
# element and adds a dash between the element and the moved character. 
# For example, the element "2two" will be changed to "two-2". Finally,
# the function converts the list back to a string, and returns the
# new string.
def change_string(given_string):

    # Initialize "new_string" as a string data type by using empty quotes.`
    new_string = ""

    # Split the "given_string" into a "new_list", with each "element"
    # holding an individual word from the string.
    new_list = given_string.split()

    # The for loop iterates over each "element" in the "new_list".
    for element in new_list:
        # Convert the list into a "new_string" by using the assignment
        # operator += to concatenate the following items: 
        # + Each list "element" (starting at index position [1:]), 
        # + a dash "-", 
        # + append the first character of the "element" (using the index 
        # [0]) to the end of the "element", and finally,
        # + a space " " to separate each "element" in the "new_string".
        new_string += element[1:] + "-" + element[0] + " "

    # Return the list that has been converted back into a string.
    return new_string

print(change_string("1one 2two 3three 4four 5five")) # Should print "one-1 two-2 three-3 four-4 five-5"
```
### Skill Group 5
* Use the ``string.join()`` method to concatenate a string that provides a list name and its elements.
```python
# This function accepts a list name and a list of elements, and returns
# a string with the format: "The "list_name" list includes: element1, 
# element2, element3". 
def list_elements(list_name, elements):
    # This task can be completed in a single line of code. The 
    # concatenation of strings, "list_name", and the list "elements" can
    # occur on the return line. In this case, the string "The " is added 
    # to the "list_name", plus the string " list includes: ", then the
    # "elements" are joined using a comma to separate each element of the 
    # list.
    return "The " + list_name + " list includes: " + ", ".join(elements)

print(list_elements("Printers", ["Color Printer", "Black and White Printer", "3-D Printer"]))
# Should print "The Printers list includes: Color Printer, Black and White Printer, 3-D Printer"
```
### Skill Group 6
* Use ``map()`` and convert the map object to a list so we can print all the results at once.
```python
# A simple function to add 1 to a given number
def add_one(number):
    return number + 1

# A list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use map to apply the function to each element in the list
result = map(add_one, numbers)

# Convert the map object to a list to print the result
print(list(result))

# Outputs: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
### Skill Group 7
* Use zip() to combine a list of names and ages into a list of tuples, and print all the tuples at once.
```python
# Two lists
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]

# Use zip to combine the lists
combined = zip(names, ages)

# Convert the zip object to a list to print the result
print(list(combined))

# Outputs: [('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 30), ('Charlie', 35)]
```
