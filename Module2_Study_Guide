### Reminder: Corrext syntax is crusial
**Common syntax errors:**
* Misspellings
* Incorrect indentations
* Missing or incorrect key characters:
    * Parenthetical types - ( curved ), [ square ], { curly }
    * Quote types - "straight-double" or 'straight-single', “curly-double” or ‘curly-single’. This is especially important because I personally often forget to add quote types for str().
    * Block introduction characters, like colons - :
* Data type mismatches
* Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words
* Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language
